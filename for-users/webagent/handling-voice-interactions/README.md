# Handling Voice Interactions

Voice calls remain the fastest way to resolve complex questions. **AnywhereNow NEO WebAgent** gives you full telephony controls in a single browser tab—no desk phone or softphone required.

### What You’ll Learn

* Accept and end inbound calls
* Place callers on hold and resume the conversation
* Consult with a colleague or transfer the call
* Add additional parties to create a conference
* Dial outbound numbers or click‑to‑call from records
* Use the Call Controls toolbar effectively

Each task has its own page so you can jump straight to the step‑by‑step instructions you need.
