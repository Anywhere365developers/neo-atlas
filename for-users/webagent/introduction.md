### Key Concepts

#### Omnichannel Inbox

Handle voice and digital interactions side‑by‑side without juggling multiple windows. Routing decisions are handled upstream, so you focus on the customer.

#### Presence & Capacity

Your presence status (Available, Away, Busy) plus channel capacity rules determine which interactions land on your desktop. Adjust status at any time from the top toolbar.

#### Plugins & Integrations

WebAgent embeds into Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, Salesforce, SAP C4C, ServiceNow, Bullhorn, and other workspaces. Each integration adds context panels and screen pops relevant to that platform.

#### Security by Design

Sessions are secured with OAuth/OIDC, all media streams are encrypted, and no customer data is stored locally. See **Administrator Guide → Security & Compliance** for details.

### Next Steps

1. **Agents**: Jump to **Getting Started** to sign in and explore call controls.
2. **Admins**: Review **Planning & Requirements** to confirm prerequisites, then follow an installation path that matches your environment.

Happy engaging!
