# Change Your Presence Status

Your presence tells the routing engine whether you can receive new interactions.

1. Click the **Presence Selector** in the MePerson menu (top right).
2. Choose **Available** to receive work or **Away** if you need a break.
3. _Busy_ is applied automatically when you’re on a call or chat.

More options are covered in **Change Your Presence Status**.
